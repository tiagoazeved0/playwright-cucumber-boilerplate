Here's the corrected README.md with the necessary steps to start that server and make the reporting work correctly:

# Playwright BDD Project

This project is a boilerplate for running end-to-end (E2E) tests using Playwright and Playwright-BDD. It provides a structured framework with Cucumber integration for writing tests in a behavior-driven development (BDD) style.

## Features

- **Playwright:** A powerful Node.js library for automating Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit browsers.
- **Playwright-BDD:** Integrates Playwright with Cucumber for BDD-style testing.
- **Cucumber Reports:** Generates detailed HTML reports for test execution.
- **Multiple Browser Support:**  Runs tests on Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit.
- **Parallel Execution:**  Executes tests in parallel for faster results.
- **Automatic Retries:**  Retries failed tests to handle flaky scenarios.
- **Global Setup/Teardown:**  Allows for custom setup and teardown procedures.
- **Screenshots and Traces:** Captures screenshots and traces for debugging.
- **Video Recording:** Records videos of test runs for visual analysis.
